# Simulated Rail Transit System

#### Description:
##### This is a representation of the rail portion of a regional transportation system. It allows for multiple rail lines to be modeled with stations based on coordinates. All user-defined properties of the rail system, and any interactions will take place through an API. A graphical interface will be provided for interacting with the API and also for rendering a representation of the rail system. Locations of trains will be shown based on provided schedule information.

#### Purpose:
##### The main purpose of this project is for the author to showcase his skills at planning and implementing a secure API to model an actual metropolitan rail service.

#### Technologies used:
* Node
* Express
* React
* Redux
* GraphQL
* Postgresql

#### User stories:
* User should be able to define a train route with coordinates for each of the stations.
* User should be able to create trains with properties such as train number and capacity.
* User should be able to define a schedule for trains.
* User should be able to create passengers with ticket from station of origin to destination station.
